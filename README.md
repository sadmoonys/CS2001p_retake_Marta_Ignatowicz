NOTEWARE

What is Noteware?          <img src="https://github.com/BrunelCS/cs2001-2020_21-group15/blob/main/front/src/Images/NWLOGO.png" width="200">


  We are creating an application which allows users to study collaboratively with other students across the globe. 

Why have we made Noteware?

  The pandemic has forced many of us to study without our friends like we used to. 
  Many students are struggling with the changes since they are no longer able to share notes with other students effectively.
  
  Noteware aims to be a means to an end for these struggles, essentially acting as a social media for studying.
